# Tunify-Protype :notes:
#### A prototype for an app that listens to a song and provides similar songs and artists. If the user does not want to use audio, they also have an option to type an artist or song name in the search bar. The app will provide songs and artists catered to the user's music taste.

### Technology Used:
This prototype was creating using a UI/UX design platform called Figma.

### Process:
I started by creating a reference frame that would be the basis of the style used for the rest of the frames. I then created the main frames/outline of the project. I copied and pasted a lot of frames in this step. Next, I added changes to the copied frames to demo all of the possible search methods in the app. Finally, I added a flow to the frames so that they can be interactive when presented (buttons, sliding pages, etc...).

### Plans for Future Development:
I created this prototype as part of a group project with my friends. I was in charge of developing the frontend and helping out with the backend. We are still in the process of developing this project. The full project would be made with Python and using Spotify API, Flask for the frontend, and other Python libraries.
